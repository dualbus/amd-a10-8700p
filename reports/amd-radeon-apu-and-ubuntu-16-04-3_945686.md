Title: AMD Radeon APU and Ubuntu 16.04.3
Body:

I've been working on installing Ubuntu on my HP hp 15-ab153nr for the last
couple of days. I have tried Ubuntu 16.04.3 and 17.04. I think I have read
every post between here and reddit regarding my issue of the AMD Radeon card
not working reliably with the current version of Ubuntu.

Ubuntu reports that the card for my laptop is a VGA compatible controller
[0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, INc. [AMD/ATi] Carrizo [1002:9874] (rev c5).

This is the old "blank screen" issue (some say black screen). Sometimes I can
boot into 16.04.3, sometimes the screen remains blank and I can only hear the
familiar drum beat signaling that the Ubuntu sign on screen is up.

When I am able to log in, I have some time to run some housekeeping, but the
screen will eventually, quite randomly, go blank.

I'm not doing any nomodeset in Grub or anything. Apparently, that's no longer a
work around in 16.04, and when I was doing it, I received very random results
anyway.

I haven't messed with AMDGPU-PRO because my card is not listed as supported.

With the number of posts I see on this, I can't believe that no one knows why
this is occurring and hasn't arrived at some sort of fix. Unfortunately, that
is outside my level of expertise, so I can only ask for assistance.

Thanks all for looking, and I hope to have some useful dialog.
